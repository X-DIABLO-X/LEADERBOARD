# Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in various programming languages. Itâ€™s designed to help understand and practice data structures concepts, which form the backbone of efficient programming and algorithm design.

## Overview

This repository includes implementations of essential data structures, each structured with comments and examples to aid understanding. Each data structure is implemented in a modular way, allowing easy integration into various projects and applications.

## Prerequisites

To work with the code in this repository, you need:
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or similar.
- Familiarity with a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, or C++).
- A basic understanding of data structures and algorithms concepts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataStructures.git
   cd DataStructures
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Language Folder**:
   Go to the folder for your preferred language (e.g., `python/`, `java/`, `cpp/`).

3. **Run the Code**:
   - For Python:
     ```bash
     python data_structure_name.py
     ```
   - For Java:
     ```bash
     javac DataStructureName.java
     java DataStructureName
     ```
   - For C++:
     ```bash
     g++ data_structure_name.cpp -o data_structure_name
     ./data_structure_name
     ```

## Implemented Data Structures

The following data structures are included in this repository:

### Linear Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list implementations.
- **Stacks**: Stack operations (push, pop, peek) with array and linked list implementations.
- **Queues**: Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue) with array and linked list implementations.
  
### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Trees**:
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - AVL Trees
  - Heaps (Min and Max)
- **Graphs**:
  - Representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
  - Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)

### Hashing
- **Hash Tables**: Collision handling using separate chaining and open addressing.

### Additional Structures
- **Tries**: Prefix trees for efficient string storage and search.
- **Bloom Filters**: Space-efficient probabilistic data structure for membership testing.

## Usage

Each data structure folder includes:
- **Code Implementation**: The main code for the data structure.
- **Examples and Tests**: Sample usage and test cases to demonstrate functionality.

### Example Usage

For example, if you're using the **Stack** data structure in Python:

```python
from stack import Stack

# Initialize stack
my_stack = Stack()

# Push elements
my_stack.push(10)
my_stack.push(20)

# Peek at top element
print("Top element:", my_stack.peek())  # Output: 20

# Pop an element
print("Popped element:", my_stack.pop())  # Output: 20
```
